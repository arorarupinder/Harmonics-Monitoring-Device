******************************
Self notes:
try and accept 
10 arrays (colums)
do average and plot
******************************


Initialize 12cc variables for oled display
Set oled display parameters -- value (screen heights width, etc)

Initialize rotary encoder pins

Track encoder direction by setting true or false variables

get_file() function: fetch python file from pico root folder

show_menu(menu) function: displays menu on screen
			 
set_val(threshold) function: displays value on screen once encoder is pressed

thd_fft_calc() function: takes the input from the fat function and calculates the the w.r.t the first 
			order harmonics 

thd_thresh_calc(i_thresh) function: takes the input from client to calculate the thd w.r.t first 
			order harmonics 

compare_thd(thd_thresh) function: compares the thd calculated from the incoming signal and thd called 
				from client input 
				
				if thd_fft > thd_thresh
				print("Incoming current greater than threshold")
				turn on LED

				else when thd_fft < thd_thresh
        			Print("Current below threshold")
				LED remains off

Generate current in Amps options on screen using while loop

Call show_menu(options) function to generate display on screen 

Call get_file() function --needed when fetching necessary files but function also ommitted if not necessary 

Create While loop: include if-statement for encoder to move (left and right)  through the options 
		  displays on screen 

		  include if-statement for when button is pressed  
		  call function for calculating the thd w client input
		  call function to compare calculated thd from fft vs thd from client input
